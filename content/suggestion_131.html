          <h1>Summer is here!</h1>
          <p><strong>Summer is the best time to try something new. So, why don’t you try a new sport this summer?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Here are five sports we think you should try out this summer, to bring out the adrenaline-junkie in you!</strong></p>
          <p>1.<strong>Kite-Surfing</strong></p>
          <p>Remember those really cool afternoons when you were a kid and your parents would take you out to the park to fly a kite? Now imagine that, but way cooler.</p>
          <p>If you’ve seen those boys and girls standing on boards and holding kites that ride them across waves and let them jump in the air for a short flight – you’ve seen kitesurfers. Kitesurfing is fun, but it requires time. You’ll need to find a good instructor and you’ll need to be ready to suck at first. It is not an easy sport, but once you feel the adrenaline rush it gives, you won’t be able to stop!</p>
          <p>2.<strong>Wakeboarding</strong></p>
          <p>To try it, you will only need some money and a bit of courage. Almost every summer resort offers wakeboarding. What you’ll do is stand on a wakeboard and let a specially designed boat drag you across the water. Hold tight and enjoy!</p>
          <p>3.<strong>Windsurfing</strong></p>
          <p>If you want to try a new sport this summer and have a great chance to embarrass yourself – try windsurfing. Those who are experienced in this sport say that this is amazing and the beginners say that it is really fun to try. Stay tenacious! You can do it! </p>
          <p>4.<strong>Bungee Jumping</strong></p>
          <p>It's probably one of the most popular summer sports on the planet, even though it is not actually a sport. Many people choose to gather the courage and try bungee jumping during summer vacations. Well, you can be one of them too. Let someone tie the bungee rope to your ankles and jump into the unknown shouting Geronimooooo!</p>
          <p>5.<Strong>Paragliding</Strong></p>
          <p>Paragliding offers one of the purest feelings of flying. There are no noisy engines, just one wing and one pilot chasing the hot thermals to climb up in the air. Book yourself a tandem flight with an instructor. You will be the passenger, you won’t need to do anything – just enjoy the amazing feeling of flying. Bring your camera along – you’ll want those memories recorded. I warn you though – you might get easily hooked to the sport.</p>

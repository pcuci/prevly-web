          <h1>Burn more calories!</h1>
          <p><strong>No one wants to burn just a ‘few ‘ calories.  You can do more, and we can help.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Here are 3 expert tips on how to get the most out of your day and burn the most calories:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1.Exercise on a full stomach</strong></p> 
          <p>Food is fuel, and while hitting the gym right after eating sets yourself up for a food coma, having some (at least partially) digested food in your system means your muscles are stocked with the glycogen they need to work their best</p>
          <p><strong>2.Work out with your buddies</strong></p>
          <p>Okay, so hanging with your friends won't directly up your calorie burn, but it will help you go harder, longer, and without even knowing it. In one Michigan State University, women almost doubled their exercise duration (and thus, their calorie expenditure) when cycling with a virtual partner who they were told was slightly better than them. Can you imagine how many calories you could go through if you had real, live buddy alongside you? Best of all, most people don't even realize they are pushing themselves harder than they would if they were solo. One study of Oxford University rowers suggests endorphins may be one reason: It found that when team members worked out together, they released twice as many feel-good endorphins as those who exercised by themselves</p>
          <p><strong>3.Exercise outdoors</strong></p>
          <p>Trade your treadmill for the trails. Outside, varied terrain, temps, and wind resistance can help you burn more calories (some people estimate up to 10 percent more) even if you stick to your indoor pace. And even if you go the DIY boot camp route instead, chances are you will still work out longer. Why? One review of outdoor versus indoor exercise published in Environmental Science and Technology found that people consistently reported feeling more energetic and optimistic as well less tense, angry, and depressed after exercising al fresco compared to exercising indoors. Plus, they just had more fun. </p>

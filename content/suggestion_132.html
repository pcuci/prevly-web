          <h1>Summer is here!</h1>
          <p><strong>Summer is the best time to try something new. So, why don’t you try a new sport this summer?</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Here are five sports we think you should try out this summer, to bring out the adrenaline-junkie in you!</strong></p>
          <p>1.<strong>Skydiving</strong></p>
          <p>Everyone’s heard of it and it’s been on every bucket list ever made – skydiving. You can pay for a tandem jump almost everywhere in the world. You’ll jump out with an instructor and be able to experience the free fall and reaching the terminal velocity of around 125mph. Talk about an adrenaline rush, huh?</p>
          <p>2.<strong>Rafting</strong></p>
          <p>Rafting is the perfect summer sport. The weather is hot and you need something to cool down. Gather your friends, rent a raft and choose a river. It’s a good idea to hire an experienced instructor though. You don’t want to end up in the middle of nowhere because you didn’t really know how to steer the raft properly.</p>
          <p>3.<Strong>Kayaking</Strong></p>
          <p>Here comes another great choice for hot summer days – kayaking. You can try single or tandem kayaking, or even group- the more, the merrier!</p>
          <p>4.<Strong>Free Climbing</Strong></p>
          <p>Getting extremely popular in the last couple of years, free climbing is the ideal sport everybody who loves the great outdoors. I have to suggest trying it in a controlled environment and with experienced instructors first. Then you can go out and try to climb an actual rock. It’s fun and it makes your butt looks great. What more could you ask for?</p>
          <p>5.<strong>Zorbin</strong></p>
          <p>If you’ve wanted to roll down the hill when you were a kid you will love zorbing. Basically, you’ll be put inside a big ball made of transparent plastic and pushed down the hill. As simple as that. There are no special preparations needed. You can also try it on a level ground, but in that case you’ll need to run inside the ball in order to move it – not recommended for really hot days.</p>

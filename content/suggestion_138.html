          <h1>Better day, better you!</h1>
          <p><strong>Great athletes put the odds in their favor by having a routine that helps them start each day right. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Why don't you? Here are three tips to do just that.</strong></p>
          <p>1.<strong><font color="Red">Body</font></strong></p>
          <p>Coming out of bed, your body needs three things for certain--water, protein and movement. Without being indelicate, your systems were all working through the night and they need to complete their cycles. Starting with 16 ounces of water gets you started on the eight glasses you already know you need to get anyway and begins the benefits that moving fluids through your body starts.</p>
          <p>Movement gets blood moving, clears the mind and releases energy. Workouts with weights or cardio are great--but sometimes ten minutes of stretching is all you have time or space for. Regardless, don't let the first 30 minutes of the day get started without moving.</p>
          <p>2.<strong><font color="red">Mind</font></strong></p>
          <p>Your mind needs focus or you will waste time and energy in your morning and in your day. The most effective business owners and CEOs that I know actually focus on very few things. Those that receive their focus, receive all of their focus. A billionaire I interviewed told me one of his keys to success--he tries to accomplish only one thing per day. A very big thing, of course, but from the moment he woke up until he finished his day, he threw every available effort at that one thing. Most of us measure our days in volume, not in scale. How many checks on our list, not how important one big check might be. Pick the one BIG thing to accomplish and let your morning open up with that as the focus for your first thoughts.</p>
          <p>3.<strong><font color="red">Spirit</font></strong></p>
          <p>Part of putting yourself in the zone is achieving alignment of your core energy and your positive emotions. A proven way to do this is through a simple reflection of gratitude. Being grateful, aware of all you have, is a centering action. It starts your day with energy and calm. </p>
          <p>The top performers in most fields put the odds in their favor by putting themselves in the zone. Figure out your Body/Mind/Spirit routine and follow it for a better day every day.</p>

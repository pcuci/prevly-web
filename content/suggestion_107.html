          <h1>Fat-busting superfoods!</h1>
          <p><strong>Treadmills and weights arenâ€™t the only ways to fight fat. </strong></p>
          <p>These 3 superfoods will kickstart your metabolism right into action.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Yellow Bell Peppers</strong></p>
          <p>It's time to "pep" up your diet. About one-third of Americans are vitamin C deficient, and one yellow pepper supplies 341 milligrams, nearly three and a half times the amount in a large orange. The body needs vitamin C to produce a molecule called carnitine, which helps muscles use fat for energy and, in turn, boosts metabolism. Sure enough, people with higher levels of C in their blood had lower BMIs and less body fat, according to a study in the Journal of Nutrition.</p>
          <p><strong><font color="red">How to get it into your diet:</font></strong></p>
          <p>Raw yellow pepper strips make a satisfying snack with a little hummus, and they add crunch to fish tacos. Or core and clean a pepper and fill it with tuna salad (use low-fat Greek yogurt instead of mayo) for lunch.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Peanuts</strong></p>
          <p>These fiber-packed nuts don't just help curb your intake of calories, they can help torch them too. Peanuts induce a strong thermic response, which means that the process of digesting them actually burns calories. A study in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders found that when people consumed 500 calories' worth of peanuts daily for 19 weeks, their resting metabolic rate increased by 11 percent, even without added exercise.</p>
          <p><strong><font color="red">How to get it into your diet:</font></strong></p>
          <p>Don't go overboard, as peanuts are calorie-dense. Keep a stash in your purse for a quick snack (aim for one ounce, or about two tablespoons, daily), revisit your childhood with an afternoon PB&J, or make pad thai with ground peanuts for a delish fat-burning dinner.</p>
          <p><Strong>3.H2O</Strong></p>
          <p>Want to lose an extra 6.6 pounds a year? Down two glasses of water before breakfast (you can try it before any meal). People who did this in a recent study at Virginia Tech consumed an average of 75 fewer calories at their a.m. meal than those who didn't. The water acted as a calorie-free appetizer, filling participants' stomachs, so they reported less hunger just prior to eating. Other research suggests that H2O boosts metabolism, because your body has to work to raise the temperature of the ingested water to match that of your core. In one study, people who drank eight to 12 glasses a day had higher metabolic rates than those who sipped just four.</p>

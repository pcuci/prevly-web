          <h1>Memory Mania!</h1>
          <p><strong>5 simple & proven techniques to boost your memory.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Can’t find your keys? Misplaced your wallet? Blanked on your new neighbor's name?</strong></p>
          <p>When we fail to pay close attention, the memories we create are weak and we sometimes have difficulty retrieving them later. So how can you eliminate or greatly reduce such occurrences? Try these five proven strategies.</p>
          <p>1.<strong><font color="red">Remember Names</font></strong></p>
          <p>Look, snap, and connect. When you meet someone, really look at them and listen to their name- too often, we don't pay attention. Now make a mental picture (snap!) of their name and face and mentally connect them: That's Sandy, lying on a sandy beach. Just met a Mr. Paulson? Picture him shaking hands with Paul McCartney and his son. Our brains are hardwired to remember visual images.</p>
          <p>2.<strong><font color="Red">Turn your grocery list into a story</font></strong></p>
          <p>Make up a story using the items you need — the more absurd and dramatic, the better. For example: A chicken was eating cornflakes when a car burst through the wall. A monkey was driving, throwing oranges out the window; he honked wildly as he drove off a cliff into a lake filled with milk..etc. The narrative will take you from item to item until you reach the end of your list.</p>
          <p>3.<strong><font color="red">Recall Online Passwords</font></strong></p>
          <p>Computer experts have a variety of tricks for this. One good one: Create a template that you personalize for each site. For instance, you might start with a word-number combo that’s meaningful to you — say, Binky11, the name of your first dog and your age when you got him. Tack on the initials or first two letters of the website that needs a password: FN for First National Bank, for instance. You’ll remember but a hacker will never guess.</p>
          <p>4.<strong><font color="Red">Remember where you're parked.</font></strong></p>
          <p>Step 1 happens as soon as you park: Look to see what section you’re in. Step 2: Create a mental snapshot. If you’re in section 3D, imagine three dogs chasing each other around your car. Even simpler: Repeat the section number aloud a few times. Using multiple senses (speaking, hearing) helps cement the memory.</p>
          <p>5.<strong><font color="Red">At the tip of your tongue</font></strong></p>
          <p>Chances are you’ve experienced the “tip of the tongue” phenomenon, in which you know the name of the movie or the word you want but can’t quite recall it. Take advantage of the fact that your brain files memories into “neighborhoods,” says psychiatrist Small. Can you call up the star of the movie? Use that for a mental picture that will bring up the movie’s name next time you want it. Small thinks of Jeremy Irons playing dead with a bunch of rings on his fingers — and no longer forgets Dead Ringers.</p>

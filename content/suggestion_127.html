          <h1>Having trouble sleeping?</h1>
          <p><strong>The foods you eat for dinner or shortly before bed can prevent you from getting some much-needed zzz's.</strong></p>
          <p><strong> Here are 5 foods to shun for up to several hours before turning in if you want to sleep better and wake rested.</strong></p>
          <p>1.<strong><font color="blue">Tacos</font></strong></p>
          <p>A taco liberally sprinkled with hot sauce may set your taste buds tingling, but eating it within a few hours of lights-out can set you up for a bad case of heartburn and a restless night. Ditto for other spicy foods.</p>
          <p>2.<strong><font color="blue">Steak</font></strong></p>
          <p>Save the leftover slice of steak for lunch tomorrow. Foods high in protein and marbled fats, such as steak and roast beef, are slow to digest. If your body is busy digesting food, there's more of a chance that you'll have a restless night.</p>
          <p>3.<strong><font color="blue">Carbonated Soft drinks</font></strong></p>
          <p>Caffeine, that sneak thief of sleep, can turn up in unexpected places, including root beer and lemon-lime soda. Added to a food or beverage, caffeine must be listed as an ingredient; if it occurs naturally (coffee, tea, chocolate), it doesn't. Check the label.</p>
          <p>4.<strong><font color="blue">Dagwood Sandwich</font></strong></p>
          <p>A heavy meal just before bed can rob you of the shut-eye you need. Allow at least three hours post-meal before you turn in so your body has a chance to digest the food and you don't feel too uncomfortable to sleep.</p>
          <p>5.<strong><font color="blue">Broccoli</font></strong></p>
          <p>Broccoli is a nutrition powerhouse, but its slow-to-digest fiber will keep your body working hard into the night. Broccoli and its relatives cauliflower and brussels sprouts also contain an indigestible sugar that will produce large amounts of gas.</p>

          <h1>Burn more calories!</h1>
          <p><strong>No one wants to burn just a ‘few ‘ calories.  You can do more, and we can help. </strong></p>
          <p><strong> Here are 3 expert tips on how to get the most out of your day and burn the most calories:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. Eat a snack after your workout</strong></p>
          <p>Breaking down your muscles burns calories, sure, but what really torches them is building those muscles back up -- and that's where post-workout nutrition comes into play. Eating a mix of carbohydrates and protein within an hour of your cool-down helps increase your body's levels of muscle-repair-signaling hormones. That way, you'll not only build more calorie-torching muscle, but your muscles will actually spend extra energy pulling over time on the repair process</p>
          <p><strong>2. Strength training first!</strong></p>
          <p>Strength training and cardio exercise burn the most calories in that order. Why? Your body converts food to energy using both anaerobic and aerobic energy systems. Strength training primarily taps your anaerobic ones, so if you knock out your reps first, by the time to get to your cardio routine, your body has used up most if not all of its stored energy. That means your body puts its fat stores to good use and you burn more calories both in the gym and during the rest of the day. Plus, the setup allows you to hit your strength training (which is responsible for bigger calorie burns) harder than you if you completed it post-run.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Switch up your workout!</strong></Strong></p>
          <p>When it comes to your workout, there's a fine line between a routine and a rut. After all, it takes just three weeks for a fit body to adapt and become more efficient at a given exercise. And while adaptation might sound like a good thing, the more efficient your body is at a given move, the fewer calories it has to burn to complete it. Still, that doesn't mean you should haphazardly perform different exercises each time you walk into the gym. Instead progress at a given workout and setup of sets and reps, and then after four to six weeks change things up, he suggests. Altering the exercises, angles, or even just the number of sets and reps can keep your body guessing and burning more calories during every workout.</p>

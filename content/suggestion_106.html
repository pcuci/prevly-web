          <h1>Fat-busting superfoods!</h1>
          <p><strong>Treadmills and weights aren’t the only ways to fight fat. </strong></p>
          <p>These 3 superfoods will kickstart your metabolism right into action- you’re in for a sweet treat!</p>
          <p><strong>1. Dark chocolate </strong></p>
          <p>A particularly sweet study found that daily consumption of roughly one and a half ounces of dark chocolate -- about the amount in a Hershey's bar -- reduced the stress hormone cortisol. (Stress has been linked to a sluggish metabolism.) 
            Researchers suspect that certain compounds in chocolate, like caffeine and theobromine, may be responsible. Another reason to indulge: A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that adults who ate moderate amounts of chocolate regularly were actually thinner than those who didn't, even though they consumed more calories and exercised the same amount.</p>
          <p><strong>How to get it into your diet?</strong></p>
          <p>Look for chocolate that contains at least 70 percent cocoa -- the darker, the better. Pair a square with a cappuccino for a  morning pick-me-up or stir some chunks into homemade trail mix.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Sesame seeds</strong></p>
          <p>Animal studies showed that plant chemicals, called lignans, in sesame seeds enhance fat burning by increasing liver enzymes that break down fat.</p>
          <p><strong>How to get it into your diet?</strong></p>
          <p>Roast sesame seeds (spread evenly on a baking sheet and put in an oven set to 325° for about 15 minutes or until golden brown and fragrant), then sprinkle them on salads, stir-fried vegetables, chicken, fish, and soups. Spread tahini (sesame paste) on celery or bread and opt for sesame seed buns and bagels over plain.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Eggs</strong></p>
          <p>Eggs are the best protein source on the planet. They contain all nine essential amino acids, which your body needs to build muscle tissue. And the bigger your guns, the greater your fat-burning potential, because it takes more calories to maintain muscle than it does fat.</p>
          <p><strong>How to get it into your diet?</strong></p>
          <p>Start your day with two scrambled eggs instead of waffles or cereal. Or get creative and cook an egg in an avocado for a dose of healthy fats: Slice the avocado in half lengthwise, remove the pit and carve out some additional space in the center, then crack an egg into it. Bake at 425° for about 10 minutes or until set, and voila!!</p>
